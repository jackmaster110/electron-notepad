# Electron Notepad

This was built with React and Electron, and serves mainly as a proof of concept, which I'm happy to let anyone do anything with if they'd like. There's a chance I come back to it, but probably right now I'm going to work on other things. ~~There should be a working build for Windows in the releases, but~~ for Linux and Windows I had some difficulty with electron-forge. I am unsure as to why but if you'd like to take a crack at it you can be my guest.
