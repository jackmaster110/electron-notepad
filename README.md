# Electron Notepad

This was built with React and Electron, and serves mainly as a proof of concept, which I'm happy to let anyone do anything with if they'd like. There's a chance I come back to it, but probably right now I'm going to work on other things. There is a working Linux .deb build now, but I am having issues with Windows.
